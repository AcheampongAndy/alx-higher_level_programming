* Write a script that lists all states with a name starting
with N (upper N) from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:
    * Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username,
mysql password and database name (no argument validation needed)
    * You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
    * Your script should connect to a MySQL
server running on localhost at port 3306
    * Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
    * Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
    * Your code should not be executed when imported
