0. This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.
	* The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
	* You don’t have to understand what import, random. randint do. Please do not touch this code
	* The output of the program should be:
		* The number, followed by
			* if the number is greater than 0: is positive
			* if the number is 0: is zero
			* if the number is less than 0: is negative
		* followed by a new line
